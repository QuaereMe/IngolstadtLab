I call this repo "Ingolstadt Lab" as an homage to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and Counter-Reformation Scholasticism.
Hopefully the code won't live on its own.

History:
The University of Ingolstadt was a bastion of Counter-Reformation Scholasticism.
In the 18th C., it fell to the Enlightenment and secularism
Ingolstadt was closed in 1799 by Prince-Elector Maximilian I of Bavaria.

Popular Culture:
Ingolstadt was the university where Mary Shelley's Frankenstein learned chemestry.
It was also where the monster first breathed...
